**Benefits:**
- âœ… No external API dependency
- âœ… Consistent questions across attempts
- âœ… Full control over question quality
- âœ… No API costs
- âœ… Faster question loading
- âœ… Offline capability

**Implementation:**
- Removed OpenAI SDK dependency
- Simplified `/app/api/exams/generate/route.ts` from ~350 lines to ~80 lines
- Created comprehensive seed script with 50 questions per course
- Questions stored in PostgreSQL `exam_questions` table

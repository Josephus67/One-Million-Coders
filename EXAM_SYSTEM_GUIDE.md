## Configuration

### Database Setup

1. **Apply Migration:**
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://joe@localhost:5432/ghana_tech_online" \
   npx prisma migrate dev --name add_exam_and_certificate_system
   ```

2. **Seed Exam Questions:**
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://joe@localhost:5432/ghana_tech_online" \
   npx ts-node prisma/seed-exam-questions.ts
   ```
   
   This will populate:
   - Complete HTML & CSS for Beginners: 50 questions
   - JavaScript for Complete Beginners: 49 questions
   - React.js Complete Course: 50 questions
   - Python Programming Masterclass: 50 questions
   - Flutter Mobile App Development: 50 questions
   - Data Science with Python: 50 questions
   
   **Total: 299 questions** across all courses

### Adding/Updating Questions

To add or update exam questions, edit `prisma/seed-exam-questions.ts`:

```typescript
const examQuestions = {
  'course-slug': [
    {
      text: 'What is...?',
      options: ['Option A', 'Option B', 'Option C', 'Option D'],
      answer: 'Option A'
    },
    // Add more questions...
  ]
};
```

Then run the seed script again to update the database.

   - No external API dependencies

### Scoring Algorithm

```typescript
const score = Math.round((correctAnswers / totalQuestions) * 1000);
const passed = score >= 800;
```

### Security Features

- ✅ Authentication required (Clerk)
- ✅ Course enrollment verification
- ✅ Lesson completion check
- ✅ Server-side answer validation

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. Questions are the same for each exam attempt (no randomization)
2. No question shuffling between attempts
3. No partial credit for answers
4. Manual question management via seed script

### Suggested Enhancements
1. Admin UI for question management (add/edit/delete questions)
2. Question pools with rotation per attempt
3. Answer shuffling within questions
4. Timed individual questions
5. Question categories/topics/difficulty levels
6. Detailed answer explanations
7. Performance analytics dashboard
8. Proctoring features
9. Multiple exam formats (essay, coding challenges, etc.)
10. Question versioning and history

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No exam questions available
**Solution**: 
1. Verify questions are seeded: `psql -U joe -d ghana_tech_online -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM exam_questions;"`
2. Run seed script if needed: `DATABASE_URL="postgresql://joe@localhost:5432/ghana_tech_online" npx ts-node prisma/seed-exam-questions.ts`
3. Check that course has at least 40 questions

### Issue: Timer not working
**Solution**: 
1. Check browser JavaScript is enabled
2. Verify no browser extensions blocking timers
3. Check console for errors

### Issue: Certificate not downloading
**Solution**: 
1. Ensure html2pdf.js is loaded correctly
2. Check browser allows downloads
3. Try different browser if issue persists

### Issue: Exam button not showing
**Solution**: 
1. Verify all lessons marked as completed (progress = 100%)
2. Check enrollment status in database
3. Refresh the page

## Performance Considerations

- Question generation cached per course
- Minimal database queries during exam
- Client-side timer (no server polling)
- Optimistic UI updates
- Lazy loading of certificate components

## Deployment Notes

1. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in production environment
2. Run migrations: `npx prisma migrate deploy`
3. Generate Prisma client: `npx prisma generate`
4. Test exam flow with real course data
5. Monitor OpenAI API usage and costs

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check console logs for errors
2. Verify environment variables
3. Confirm database connectivity
4. Test with different browsers
5. Review API response status codes
